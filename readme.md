## Data


### Abstract

Pre-processed fMRI Stroop task data are provided in the AAL 90 node
system, as used in the analysis reported in the paper.

### Availability

No restrictions on use of included dataset.

### Description

The PI of the Stroop task study has agreed to share the data and to make
it available for this submission. The data can be found in the Reproduce
folder.

## Code


### Abstract

Matlab GUI provided version 8.3.0.532. Reproducibility code that
generates all results from the manuscript.

### Description

Code uploaded as a zipped file as a part of submission. Code includes R
code, Matlab code, and shell scripts to run everything.

## Instructions for Use


### Reproducibility

See the readme document included in the bjnl zipped folder for
instructions on how to run the Matlab GUI[]{#h.wh7p44l4mdrz .anchor}.
See the readme in each individual analysis for of the Reproducibility
folder (Reproduce) for details on how to generate the tables and figures
for each analysis.

A list of which file in the “Reproduce” folder can be used to generate
each figure is provided below:
